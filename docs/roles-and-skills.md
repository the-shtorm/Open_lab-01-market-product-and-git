## Roles and responsibilities

> **backend dev**
> - Server Logic: Writing the code that processes data, handles user authentication, and manages "behind the scenes" operations.
> - Database Management: Organizing how data (like user profiles or product listings) is stored and retrieved.
> - Scalability: Ensuring the system can handle thousands of users at once without crashing.

> **Designer**
> - UX (User Experience): Mapping out the user journey to ensure the app is intuitive and solves the user's problem.
> - UI (User Interface): Creating the visual elements—typography, color palettes, buttons, and layouts.
> - Prototyping: Building high-fidelity mockups that show exactly what the final product should look like before a single line of code is written.

> **Frontend Dev**
> - Interactivity: Making sure buttons click, menus slide, and animations play smoothly.
> - Responsiveness: Ensuring the website looks great on everything from a giant monitor to a tiny smartphone screen.
> - API Integration: Connecting the interface to the data provided by the backend.

> **Mobile engineer (iOS/Android)**
> - Platform Specifics: Developing for iOS (using Swift) or Android (using Kotlin) to ensure the app feels "native" to that phone.
> - Hardware Integration: Writing code to access the camera, GPS, push notifications, and biometric sensors (FaceID/Fingerprint).
> - Performance: Optimizing the app to run smoothly without draining the user's battery.

> **QA (Quality Assurance)**
> - Bug Hunting: Systematically testing every feature to find crashes, glitches, or logical errors.
> - Automation: Writing scripts that automatically test the software every time it is updated.
> - User Advocacy: Acting as a final check to ensure the product actually meets the requirements and provides a good experience.
